We won't be returning.
this is bad food and nothing great about it
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
satisfy about this food
good all the way
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
Very, very satisfy.
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur√©ed.
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
